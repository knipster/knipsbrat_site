Each year, on the first Saturday in June, the National Crokinole
Association (Canada) begins the new tour season with the World Crokinole
Championships in Tavistock, Ontario.

Players from around the world travel to compete for bragging rights and
cash prizes ($1,000 CAD for the first place singles winner). The top
contenders are well known in the Crokinole community and their continued
success demonstrates the degree to which crokinole is a game of skill.

This year, there were a couple of special occurrences.

First, John Conrad became the first competitor to win in both the
singles and doubles brackets during the same tournament. This was his
first singles championship. Its my understanding that John is one of the
long time backbones of the crokinole community with significant
involvement in the local club scene as well as the NCA tour and
championship itself.

Justin Slater, the 2010 WCC Champion and 2012 runner-up, set a new
record in the 20's competition. Competitors keep track of the count of
20's the make in the preliminary rounds (8 x 40 games= 320 shots). The
count for the last dozen years has been between 86-108 20's. Justin
tallied 142 20's or 44% of his shots during competitive play. Its quite
amazing, I hope to get some commentary from some of the players that at
the tournament to comment on both Justin's skill and if there were
situational factors that contributed to such a blowout. Justin appears
to be the poster child, along with the likes of Nathan Walsh, of the
next generation of dominant crokinole players.

I'm amazed and thankful for those participants that shared tweets, blogs
and especially video and photograph from Tavistock this weekend. As the
game becomes more popular, it exciting to experience the community from
a far.

I'm looking forward to making the pilgramage myself in the coming years,
I'll have to enlist some family or friends to come with me.
