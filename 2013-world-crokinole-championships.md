> This year, there were a couple of special occurrences.

In 2013, for the 15th WCC, I was there.

For the first Saturday in June, my son, Kieran, and I embarked on a
pilgramage to Tavistock, On. It was a great to meet many of the people
at the core of the Crokinole community, and even play some of the
greats.

Some highlights of the event:
    -   John Conrad won his 2nd WCC event
    -   Fred and Justin Slater won the doubles title
    -   Ray Bierling won the 20's competition with "only" 99 (down from
        142)
