From `Last Year <|filename|2012-world-crokinole-championships.rst>`_:

   Each year, on the first Saturday in June, the National Crokinole
   Association (Canada) begins the new tour season with the World Crokinole
   Championships in Tavistock, Ontario.

   Players from around the world travel to compete for bragging rights and
   cash prizes ($1,000 CAD for the first place singles winner). The top
   contenders are well known in the Crokinole community and their continued
   success demonstrates the degree to which crokinole is a game of skill.

   This year, there were a couple of special occurrences. 


In 2013, for the 15th WCC, I was there.

For the first Saturday in June, my son, Kieran, and I embarked on a pilgramage to Tavistock, On.  It was a great to meet many of the people at the core of the Crokinole community, and even play some of the greats.  

Some highlights of the event:
   * John Conrad won his 2nd WCC event
   * Fred and Justin Slater won the doubles title
   * Ray Bierling won the 20's competition with "only" 99 (down from 142)
