While playing cards with my family this morning, I saw the mailman pull
up out front for an apparent second delivery. With my birthday coming up
soon, I wondered what may have arrived from Amazon.com or similar online
store.

However, when I watched him pull out a large square flat box, my heart
jumped and I excitedly told my family that the mailman must be
delivering a new crokinole board, most likely from [Willard
Martin](http://crokinolegame.ca/willard_story.htm).

Quickly leaping to the front door, I was not disappointed! I'll have to
post a more thorough comparative review another day, but I'm very proud
of my new [Willard Pro](http://crokinolegame.ca/pro_pics.htm) board.

Thank you Mom and Dad!
