While playing cards with my family this morning, I saw the mailman pull
up out front for an apparent second delivery. With my birthday coming
up soon, I wondered what may have arrived from Amazon.com or similar
online store.

However, when I watched him pull out a large square flat box, my heart
jumped and I excitedly told my family that the mailman must be
delivering a new crokinole board, most likely from `Willard Martin`_.

Quickly leaping to the front door, I was not disappointed! I'll have
to post a more thorough comparative review another day, but I'm very
proud of my new `Willard Pro`_ board.

Thank you Mom and Dad!
