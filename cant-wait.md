   Puzzler

I know I've gone mental, while I await the work of art I `ordered`_ from
`Muzzies`_, I began to imagine sharing the game with others. Bring the
board to the office to show to friends and colleagues, bring the board
to VT to play with friends and family, having multiple games going
simultaneously.

Clearly, my mind tells me, I'm going to "need" a second board. Mind you,
I've never played this game (not really). I've now ordered 2 boards,
built a website, and started blogging about the game.

I chose to order my second board from `Joel Harpert`_ who sells
hand-made boards on ebay. I selected the Puzzler for a pre-made board
(although Joel has several options available) to get my hands on a board
faster, and I'm very interested to see Joel's unique rail construction.
He uses solid wood with gentle curves that fit together with "puzzle
joints".

On the ebay page, I merely selected the standard/natural finishes for
surface, ditch and rails as well as brass/amber posts and "bought it
now." Joel followed up with me via email, and generously upgraded me to
stained rails (my choice of Walnut or Jacobian). Joel shipped my board
(natural with walnut stained rails) on today.
