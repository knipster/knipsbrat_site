Amongst my searches for everything online about crokinole, I discovered
some player profiles at Ray and Jason Beierling's [Crokinole
Depot](http://www.crokinoledepot.com/). Interestingly Ray interviewed a
few top tier players and asked them who made their favorite
[boards](http://knipsbrat.knipster.net/boards/builders). The answer's
didn't surprise me, except for one.

[Quin Erzinger](http://www.crokinoledepot.com/quin-erzinger.html),
winner of the 2011 British Columbia Crokinole championshoip (at 17),
mentioned "Clif Antypowich's Home Made Board". I was very curious to
find a photograph of this board, and it took me a day to do so.

"This is the board I made from a cross-cut piece from a maple tree. It's
a solid one piece of wood. The score circles are inlaid brass rod, posts
are brass bolts. It's built to tournament specs. One of a kind...never
can be duplicated!"

I had the privilege to correspond with Clif, but I'll have to write
about that in a future post.
