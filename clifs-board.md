`Clifs crokinole board`_

Amongst my searches for everything online about crokinole, I discovered
some player profiles at Ray and Jason Beierling's `Crokinole Depot`_.
Interestingly Ray interviewed a few top tier players and asked them who
made their favorite `boards`_. The answer's didn't surprise me, except
for one.

`Quin Erzinger`_, winner of the 2011 British Columbia Crokinole
championshoip (at 17), mentioned "Clif Antypowich's Home Made Board". I
was very curious to find a photograph of this board, and it took me a
day to do so.

"This is the board I made from a cross-cut piece from a maple tree. It's
a solid one piece of wood. The score circles are inlaid brass rod, posts
are brass bolts. It's built to tournament specs. One of a kind...never
can be duplicated!"

I had the privilege to correspond with Clif, but I'll have to write
about that in a future post.
