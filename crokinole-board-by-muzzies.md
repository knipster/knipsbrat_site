The first board I ordered arrived from Nova Scotia today. Sue shipped
the board only 6 days ago, not bad for international postal service.

The board is maple plywood with a Red Chestnut stained playing surface,
and clear poly for the ditch and rails. Murray and Sue do excellent
finish work, and the brass screws have brass sleeves that make me wonder
if I want to use the included rubber sleeves on the posts.

Unlike many boards, the Skalings also finish the back of the board and
even make a keyhole for hanging your board. These nice touches are
indicators of the pride in their work and the attention to detail of the
workmanship.

The playing surface is immaculate and finely finished. Muzzies boards
have painted lines. I believe each concentric ring actually thickens
slightly. Its a beautiful board. I'll have to get back to you on playing
differences.
