Crokinole is a game with unique culture that naturally brings people
together. I was reminded of this while playing doubles with my brother,
son and father-in-law over the weekend.

Within a family

Similar to card games, and traditional board games such as backgammon,
checkers, and chess, crokinole is a low tech game that is played between
people facing each other over a table or playing surface. This attribute
by itself reminds us to turn off the TVs, iPods and computers and spend
sometime together as friends and family.

Unlike these games, crokinole comes with a more casual and fast paced
game that can be played while having a conversation and with a number of
players taking turns at the board. And even further, the simple rules
and heirloom nature of handmade boards transcends generations and can be
enjoyably played among grandparents and grandchildren. The generational
nature must also conjure nostalgia and a connection with the passed with
those fortunate enough to be in possession of hand-me-down boards.

Among families

While I haven't yet had experience with a crokinole club as exist in
Ontario, British Columbia, and PEI, I'm impressed by the commitment and
distance traveled by enthusiasts to attend regional and national
tournaments. The greater crokinole community, while small, seems to be
filled with authentic, unassuming, and diverse people who appreciate
some of the simple yet fundamental principles of pride in one's efforts,
consideration of others, and joys of rich human interaction.

Building a community?

While I consider a "pilgramage" to Tavistock, I'm thinking my next steps
is to organize a series of small gatherings and/or creation of a small
club.
