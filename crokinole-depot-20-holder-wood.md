A friend and I ordered a pair of 20 holders from [Crokinole
Depot](http://www.crokinoledepot.com/index.html). I was excited to order
this for a number of reasons. First, Crokinole Depot is run by Ray and
Jason Beierling who are active in the Crokinole community and ranked
players. Their website and participation in online message boards have
been great sources of information for me while learning about the game.
In a sense, they are Heroes of the game.

We received our order only a week or so after ordering, but found
communication (by email or twitter) to be difficult if at all possible.
These are perfectly functional twenty holders, and look just like the
photo. They are a huge step up from my daughter's "Hello Kitty"
children's bowl that we've been using. That said, they aren't the same
level of quality as a Muzzies' Crokinole board.

The communication challenges are more concerning since one of the
holders arrived broken (one of the end pieces snapped near the base).
While I'm trying to repair it with glue, a replacement, refund or some
other arrangement would be preferable.

As far as the item is concerned, its a fairly plain pine piece
apparently constructed in a manner similar to the method description on
[BoardGameGeek.com](http://BoardGameGeek.com) and stamped on both sides with the Crokinole
Depot logo in which the "depot" is actually somewhat obscure. I had
expected the routed groove at the bottom to be "rounded", but found it
to be a straight roughly 1/2" groove. While this sits on my Muzzies rail
fine, it would likely shift or lean with a strong table bump or
earthquake (both of which events are as likely to mess up the round in
progress anyway).

[**UPDATE**: Turns out the 20 holder is sized for the rail thickness of a Willard board which is slightly thicker than a Muzzies board]


At the end of this review, I consider it a "meh." I had higher
expectations, but in hindsight, shouldn't have for a $20 investment. I'd
like to obtain the Crokinole movie, but I'm a little nervous with the
communications issues.

[**UPDATE**: After reporting the damaged 20 holder, CrokinoleDepot
immediately refunded the price of the damaged item]
