A friend and I ordered a pair of 20 holders from `Crokinole Depot`_. I
was excited to order this for a number of reasons. First, Crokinole
Depot is run by Ray and Jason Beierling who are active in the Crokinole
community and ranked players. Their website and participation in online
message boards have been great sources of information for me while
learning about the game. In a sense, they are Heroes of the game.

We received our order only a week or so after ordering, but found
communication (by email or twitter) to be difficult if at all possible.
These are perfectly functional twenty holders, and look just like the
photo. They are a huge step up from my daughter's "Hello Kitty"
children's bowl that we've been using. That said, they aren't the same
level of quality as a Muzzies' Crokinole board.

The communication challenges are more concerning since one of the
holders arrived broken (one of the end pieces snapped near the base).
While I'm trying to repair it with glue, a replacement, refund or some
other arrangement would be preferable.

As far as the item is concerned, its a fairly plain pine piece
apparently constructed in a manner similar to the method description on
`BoardGameGeek.com`_ and stamped on both sides with the Crokinole Depot
logo in which the "depot" is actually somewhat obscure. I had expected
the routed groove at the bottom to be "rounded", but found it to be a
straight roughly 1/2" groove. While this sits on my Muzzies rail fine,
it would likely shift or lean with a strong table bump or earthquake
(both of which events are as likely to mess up the round in progress
anyway).

At the end of this review, I consider it a "meh." I had higher
expectations, but in hindsight, shouldn't have for a $20 investment. I'd
like to obtain the Crokinole movie, but I'm a little nervous with the
communications issues.

[UPDATE: After reporting the damaged 20 holder, CrokinoleDepot
immediately refunded the price of the damaged item]
