As "long-time" readers of [KnipsBrat](http://knipsbrat.com) may
remember, I (re)discovered Crokinole by way of [Penny
Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com). They held their east coast
exposition Apr 6-8, 2012 in Boston.

Culminating a weekend of gaming madness, they capped their Omegathon (16
team multi-game tournament) with a match of Crokinole. The final round
was recorded and currently available at \`Twitch.tv\`\_ (jump to 7:40 to
get to the instructions). The "omeganauts" were very new to crokinol
e
(and weren't very good) and the rules were definitely not NCA standard
rules, but it was entertaining to see crokinole so prominently featured.

Couple of side notes: I wonder who made that board, and can anyone
confirm that the match was filmed with an overhead GoPro HD?
