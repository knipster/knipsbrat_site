As "long-time" readers of `KnipsBrat`_ may remember, I (re)discovered
Crokinole by way of `Penny Arcade`_.  They held their east coast
exposition Apr 6-8, 2012 in Boston.

Culminating a weekend of gaming madness, they capped their Omegathon
(16 team multi-game tournament) with a match of Crokinole.   The final
round was recorded and currently available at  `Twitch.tv`_ (jump to
7:40 to get to the instructions).   The "omeganauts" were very new to
crokinole (and weren't very good) and the rules were definitely not NCA
standard rules, but it was entertaining to see crokinole so prominently
featured.

Couple of side notes:  I wonder who made that board, and can anyone
confirm that the match was filmed with an overhead GoPro HD?
