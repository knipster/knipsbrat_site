Armed with an iPhone and tripod mount, my brother and I put on a live
demonstration of crokinole for our parents.

I'm sure this is possible with Skype or similar, but there was something
funny about the multiple camera angle effect with both players' faces as
well as a 'top down' view of the game board.

Perhaps the WCC would consider live streaming featured tables this
coming June from Tavistock!

Could crokinole be the next 'world series of poker'?
