Setup my new crokinole board on a 32" inch table in the family room for
the long weekend.   2 person games, 4 person games, adult games, and
kid games.   While I wouldn't call it an obsession, it got plenty of
play from both my family and our hosts.   

As expected, it was a nice change of pace from the the iPods, Nintendos,
and TVs that come between us as people.   One of our hosts' kids even
expressed a little disappointment as I packed up the board when we left
this morning.  Maybe I'll have to send them some links.

I think I still need a more reliable and confident packing method.
