So I received my copy of "Crokinole", the movie from `Crokinole Depot`_
along with Joe Fulop's book, "It's Only Crokinole, But I Like It."

Given my "obsession" with the game, the movie is a great look into the
personalities of the game. Set in 2004, it's actually a look back in
recent history of the game. I got a kick out of seeing interviews and a
glimpse at the personalities of Joe Fulop, Al Fuhr, Wayne Kelly, Bob
Mader as well as apparently early views of Brian Cook and the
Beierling's, Ray and Jason.

One of the big themes in the interviews and movie is the big fish, small
pond nature of competitive crokinole. These players are very well known
in the crokinole community but are as anonymous as anyone else in the
rest of their lives.

I like the mixture of humility and confidence, seriousness and
casualness of "real" people. Some of the charm comes from the Canadian
accents and local idiom's in the interviews.

The style of the movie is documentary, but frequently comes off similar,
Cinéma-vérité style, to "The Office" or Modern family. One quirky aside
with Bob Mader, shows "a guy from the village collecting snake" in the
background.

I'm also intrigued by the apparent use of Burce Lite 'n' Natural Liquid
Paste wax on WCC boards.

I do recommend this movie for fans of the game. That said, my children
has described me as obsessed, punctuated by my 8 9 year-old son
shouting, "My dad made me watch a **crokinole** movie!"
