In the few times that I haven't had a partner since receiving my board.
I figure I want to practice and develop my skills.

A clean solitaire game has emerged.

1.  Place opposing 12 discs on the board in a predictable arrangement

    -   I recommend around the 5/10 line at 12 points around (including
        the 4 quadrant lines)

2.  Play each of your 12 discs with standard rules (e.g. must hit an
    opposing disc)
3.  Score with standard rules

My best so far is 100. What is yours?
