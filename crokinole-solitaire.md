   Solitaire\_crokinole

In the few times that I haven't had a partner since receiving my board.
I figure I want to practice and develop my skills.

A clean solitaire game has emerged.

#. Place opposing 12 discs on the board in a predictable arrangement

   -  I recommend around the 5/10 line at 12 points around (including
      the 4 quadrant lines)

#. Play each of your 12 discs with standard rules (e.g. must hit an
   opposing disc)
#. Score with standard rules

My best so far is 100. What is yours?
