[Crokinole (2006)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0830805/)

I haven't got my hands on a copy yet, but in 2006, a movie was made.
Directed by Joshua &Jonathan Steckley, the film reportedly introduces us
to characters such as Mr. Crokinole (Wayne Kelly), Willard Martin and
"the Wayne Gretzky of Crokinole", Joe Fulop, in a light hearted
documentary surrounding the World Crokinole Championship in Tavistock,
Ontario.
