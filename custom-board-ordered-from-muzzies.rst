   `Muzzies`_

After quite a bit of research and a gentle nudge from a friend or two, I
decided to purchase a board from Murray & Sue Skaling (`muzzies.ca`_). I
had strongly considered a `newly available`_ Hilinski board which had a
gorgeous surface, but I had some personal concerns about the rail seams
and multi-piece construction of the base.

I corresponding with Murray completely by email, his standard boards are
already gorgeous but during our exchange we discussed alternative
finishes for the surface, ditch, rails and center as well as options for
the lines. I was able to email Murray a photograph, found online, of a
board that I liked, and that proved useful in determining the final
customization.

It was a completely pleasant exchange, and I paid for my order via
Paypal and patiently (well not really) await Murray's progress through
his queue of orders. I'm expecting him to complete and ship my board
mid-February, I'll keep you updated.
