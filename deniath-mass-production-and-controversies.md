Over at [BoardGameGeek](http://bgg.cc/forum/41557/weykick/general),
there's been a flurry of discussion surrounding Mayday Games,
[Deniath](http://www.deniath.com) and
[Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maydaygames/weykick-dexterity-game-2-4-players-by-mayday-games/comments).

The background is this:

-   MayDay Games has been building and distributing mass-produced
    Crokinole boards made in China. These are not "handmade" games, but
    better than the cardboard options found at toy stores
-   Like any larger scale operation, there have been bumps in the road.
-   Deniath is a website offering "members" private sales and discounts
    on games. They have Mayday Crokinole board's on sale over the next
    couple of days. (let me know if you want an invite)

The gist of the discussion is concern over distribution of an unrelated
game, Weykick, by Mayday both through KickStarter and Deniath. Given the
circumstances, I would recommend avoiding purchasing crokinole boards
from MayDay at least until the latest generation of boards have been
reviewed and you've found retailers with boards in stock.

$100 or less boards of reasonable quality to expand the game. Between
cost of materials, basic construction and shipping, it's definitely
challenging to do at scale. Of course, there is something special about
a heirloom quality hand made board.
