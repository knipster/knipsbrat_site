Between Christmas 2011 and New Year's Day 2012, I happened to
(re)discover Crokinole while [browsing the
internet](http://penny-arcade.com/2011/12/26). After quickly finding
myself perusing the forum's at [BoardGameGeek.com][bgg], I was bewitched
by this game and the boards on which it was played.

Something about the attention to detail, personalization, and obsession
of other's was virulently contagious. Reading reviews, [finding
photographs](http://bgg.cc/images/thing/521/crokinole) of newly arrived
boards, and discovering the intensity of crokinole players continued to
fuel my curiousity and, frankly, lust.

The quest for more information, the decision to purchase a board of my
own, the correspondence with the maker only further engrossed my
attention. Its a strange coincidence that one of the many names for this
game ("Knipsbrat") matched my online persona ("Knipster") so closely.

I ordered a board from Murray Skaling of [Muzzies](http://muzzies.ca/),
and I can't wait to receive it. I suspect the inability to quickly get a
proper board also adds to the allure.

Impatient, I have placed orders for additional boards, and cancelled all
but one of those. I look forward to reporting my learnings, and
experiences with this game.

I hope I like it.
