Over president's day weekend, here in the United States, my family is
traveling north to Vermont to stay and ski with friends. Our friends
have a nice home close to a ski area and enjoy getting away from the
hustle and bustle of the city. I've decided to bring a crokinole board
and expect it's the right kind of game for a ski-cation. I don't imagine
it's easy to pack when traveling by air, rail or bus. I even removed the
posts for travel, and have it on top of the bags in the back of the car.

Leave a comment if you have experience traveling with 1 or more boards?
How do you pack and protect them (especially the posts). A gong bag or
similar seems fine for a car ride, but longer than that?
