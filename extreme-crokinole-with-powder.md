Not surprisingly, I've enjoyed watching videos on YouTube of crokinole
tournament highlights and especially the final's matches: definitely
check out [Nathan Walsh's series](http://www.youtube.com/user/lshgmail).

Besides the level of play, the striking difference I've noticed is the
way the pieces appear to float during the ricochet. I've often suspected
this is due to the powders and lubricants in use, but I've yet to
experience them first hand, until yesterday.

My parents have come to visit for the weekend and brought both a can of
\#3 shuffleboard powder (yuck, its like sand) and a bottle of [Mespi
Anti-Friction Powder (for
Crokinole/Carrom)](http://www.timewellspentgames.com/html/gamepage.php?id=82).
I put only a tiny bit (teaspoon or less) in the ditch in front of both
of us and was amazed by how fine the grain is and how much fast and less
friction it brought to the game.

I'll have to follow up with more details, but let me say it does change
the game.
