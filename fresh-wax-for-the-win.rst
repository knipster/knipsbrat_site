Shortly after receiving my Puzzler board, I wrote about the process and
results of waxing. I performed my second waxing today and went out of my
way to be more generous with the wax as well as letting it dry for 20
minutes before wiping it off. I basically let it dry 10-15 minutes.

Huge difference. The board is lightning fast and the discs appear to
float. I found it improved my 20 percentage significantly. A gentler
touch brings with it improved accuracy.

Let your carnuba dry a little before buffing and enjoy the speed!
