The [Gamecraft
Quadpod](http://www.amazon.com/Gamecraft-HM40230XBM-Quadpod/dp/B000BR7I4I)
initially looks like a compelling and inexpensive portable table for a
Crokinole board. Unfornately, it didn't live up to my expectations.
Fortunately I found an inexpensive version on eBay. The image available
widely online shows a thin rectangular surface. This is NOT included
with or attached to the "stand." It is an illustration of a carrom board
resting on the 4 points of the stand.

The Quad pod is really 4 steel tubes, with a clever bracket pivot
arrangemen that creates a level 4 point support for a sturdy
"boardgame." While a crokinole board does sit sturdy on this stand (and
more so than a inexpensive and shaky cardtable), at 36 inches high (not
adjustable), its too tall for adults to sit much less children.

There does appear to be a "junior" version which is 30 inches high. This
is likely the right height, but I'm not sure it will be as steady given
how close the "points" would be. Drop me a comment if you have
experience with the Quadpod Jr.
