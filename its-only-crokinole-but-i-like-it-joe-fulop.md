Along with the DVD, "Crokinole", I received a copy of Joe Fulop's
"book."   While he clearly put time into the text, it's a comb-bound
book reminiscent of a high school term paper.

I liked the look inside an accomplished player's mind, but I did find
the prose repetitive.   The recent additions by Brian Cook, and Ray
Beierling make better blog entries than a "book"

I did like the numerous board diagrams and statistics of Joe's abilities
in his prime.   For example, 70% or more of free shots on the 20 hole
should be made.  For buttons within the 15 circle, he states that the
world class players can knock the opponents button off the board and
sink a 20 more than half the time!   

I'm at ~30% on my free 20s, clearly I have a ways to go.

I'm not sure the text is worth $20/copy except for the most obsessed
students of the game.  

I'm tempted to reach out and get permission to post excerpts online.
