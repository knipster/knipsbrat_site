Having actually been playing the game for a couple of weeks, allow me to
share some of the joys I've discovered.

The large board aside, its quick and easy to play a round or 2 of
crokinole. Sit down, separate the discs and start flicking. A quick
round can be played in under a minute, and a long one doesn't last more
than 4 minutes. One doesn't have to commit to a 20 - 60 minute game to
enjoy themselves.

The game is accessible and enjoyable regardless of age. My 8 eight year
old son certainly has the dexterity to play and make decent shots. 4-5
might be on the young side, but flicking the pieces around the board can
still be enjoyable.

Skill shots are definitely rewarding: successfully hitting an open 20,
or knocking an opponents piece off the board while leaving your own
piece in a good spot results in a fair bit of pride. At the same time, a
lucky shot can bring racous laughter as did my double take-out (knocked
2 of my opponents pieces off the board) that fell into the 20-hole!

The game encourages players to unplug, turn off. The turns move fast
enough that electronic distractions are less likely to intrude, and the
sound and feel of chips bouncing and careening off the board satisfies
that desire for instant feedback.
