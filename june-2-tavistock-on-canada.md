The [world crokinole championships](http://worldcrokinole.com/) are held
annually the first Saturday of June. Players from all over the world
(mostly Canada) converge on the small town to test their chops with the
best. I'd love to attend, but I'm not sure if there's a [decent
alternative](http://g.co/maps/4qbhy) to the long drive... Perhaps flying
part way? Who's with me?
