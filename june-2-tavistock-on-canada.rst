The `world crokinole championships`_ are held annually the first
Saturday of June. Players from all over the world (mostly Canada)
converge on the small town to test their chops with the best. I'd love
to attend, but I'm not sure if there's a `decent alternative`_ to the
long drive... Perhaps flying part way? Who's with me?
