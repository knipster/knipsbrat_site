The NCA (National Crokinole Association) Tour begins the first Saturday
of each June with the World Crokinole Championships in Tavistock, ON.
Today is the tour finale with the St. Jacob's tournament as previously
mentioned on this blog.

As a Canadian-American [ :D ] fan of the game, its one of those unusual
times I get to see terms like NCA that aren't United States-centric. I'm
starting to see some references to the tournament on twitter, and I'm
hoping Nathan Walsh gets some more quality video.

As a game well suited for "obsessives," it's great to see so much
commitment for such a small community. Good luck to the tournament
organizers and competitors today.
