During my research on Crokinole craftsman, I had come across a few
photographs of boards made by "Allinent." One of the side effects of
ordering a handcrafted item, is waiting for it to be handcrafted and
delivered.

Occasionally, you'll find the `Hilinski's`_ maintaining small
inventory.  Today, I noticed Allinent has `posted several boards on
eBay`_ and is asking $150 or $165 USD + $40 shipping. I've never seen
one of these boards in real life, nor have I read any reviews of them,
but the photographs sure looked nice. A handcrafted canadian board
under $200 shipped isn't too shabby.

One question I would ask prior to purchase is the dimensions of the play
surface. Most tournament sized boards are described as a 26" play
surface: With lines at 4, 8, 12 inches from the center + a 1 inch area
beyond the 12 inch ring. Allinent describes his/her boards as 25.5".
I don't expect this to be a big deal as I usually place my pieces
forward on the shooting line anyway. But I would definitely make sure
the circles are at 4, 8, and 12.

*Update 6/6/2013:  Allinet confirms these are tournament sized boards*

If you purchase one of these boards, please contact me in the comments
and tell me about your board.
