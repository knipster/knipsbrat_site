From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crokinole):

The earliest known crokinole board was made by craftsman Eckhardt Wettlaufer
in 1876 in Perth County, Ontario, Canada. Several other home-made boards of
southwestern Ontario origin, and dating from the 1870s, have been discovered
since the 1990s. It seems to have been patented on April 20, 1880, in New York
City by Joshua K. Ingalls.

Crokinole is often believed to be of Mennonite or Amish origins, but there is
no factual data to support such a claim. The reason for this misconception may
be due to its popularity in Mennonite and Amish groups. The game was viewed as
a rather innocuous pastime â€“ unlike the perception that diversions such as
card playing or dancing were considered "works of the Devil" as held by many
19th-century Protestant groups. The oldest roots of crokinole, from the 1860s,
suggest the British and South Asian games are the most likely antecedents of
what became crokinole.
