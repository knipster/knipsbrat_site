"Knipsbrat" is the lesser known name of the game, Crokinole.   Knipsbrat
translates to "flick board" in the Low-German spoken by Mennonite players.

Crokinole stands out as a game that is beautiful as much for its play as the
many ways it can be appreciated.

Crokinole players take turns sliding wooden discs towards the center of a
circular board, while knocking their opponents discs away or off the board.

Discs remaining on the board at the end of a round score 15, 10, or 5 points
depending on which circle they remain.  The net score (higher - lower) is
added to the running tally of each players total score.  Games are typically
played to 100 or 200.   The twist to the rules is the what makes a valid shot.
A valid shot starts on the outer line within the players quadrant.  One of the
opponents discs must be struck (directly or indirectly) as the result of the
play or all of the shooter's discs that were struck are removed from the
playing surface.   If the opponent has no discs on the board, the shooter must
move at least 1 piece into the 15-circle or 20-hole to have made a valid shot.

Crokinole in its current form emerged in Ontario, Canada in the mid-to-late
19th century.  Its history and popularity have spread the game through North
America, Asia and Europe.

Boards are often hand-made and passed through families as heirlooms and
treasured items.  More the one anecdote has been written about finding or
rescuing a family board.  Although standards have emerged with the increased
tournament play, Crokinole boards are frequently custom made by or for their
owners, and each board has its own unique character and aesthetic.

Crokinole is experiencing a resurgence of popularity in recent years and has
grown to somewhat of a cult-like following in communities such as
BoardGameGeek.com.  The game stands out as an attractive, easy to learn, and
physical game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages.   The fine crafted
equipment and community created by friends and family sitting around the board
are a pleasant contrast to faces buried in electronic games and television
screens.
