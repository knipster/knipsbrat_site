Dave and Norm Lagasse of Sante Fe, New Mexico:
  ~ Like so many other families of Canadian descent, among our most
    valued family heirlooms is a "pichenotte" board (shown at left).
    Ours was made by our grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, back in 1926 out
    of a wooden starch crate (you can still make out the original
    stenciling on the back of the board). His grocery business in
    Connecticut was the source of the wood crate. For many family
    occasions, the pichenotte board was an essential element.

While at 15th World Crokinole Championships in Tavistock, ON. I had
occassion to view one of the Lagasse brothers'
[Pichenotte](http://www.pichenotte.com) boards.

It certainly is a work of art. A crokinole board in every way, the posts
are quite a fine work with a rubber o-ring around the center. The ditch
was covered with a fine felt. It was really quite spectacular.

Most foreign, however, were the pucks, which were made of a plastic and
cut in such a strange shape that they do not have a solid surface in
contact with the board.
