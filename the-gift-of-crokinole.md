Today is my father's birthday. I imagine he's been watching my recent
crokinole obsession with both curiosity and a bit of familiarity.
Obsessive hobbies run in the family.

What might be particularly funny for long time Knipsbrat readers, is
that it wasn't immediately obvious that this would make a good birthday
present. My father is one of those ridiculous-to-shop-for people who
either has "it", or doesn't want "it."

One Christmas, my brother and I both showed up beaming with pride
asserting we had found the perfect gifts for our father. Imagine
everyone's surprise when my father opened two [Klein
Bottles](http://kleinbottle.com/).

So, obviously my brother quickly agreed to partner with me on this
purchase of a fine Hilinski crokinole board:
[Burton](http://www.hilinski.net/woodgames/crokinole_gallery/Burton.jpg)
is what we ended up with. I'm looking forward to visiting and playing on
it.

I've heard my father is looking into purchasing a few cues to deal with
his "[handicap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dupuytren's_contracture)."
Maybe I can get him to guest write a post. The cues category at the
[WCC](http://www.worldcrokinole.com) does use lazy susan's, and requires
players to bring their own cue, but still adheres (pun intended) to the
one-cheek rule.
