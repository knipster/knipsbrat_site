Today is my father's birthday. I imagine he's been watching my recent
crokinole obsession with both curiosity and a bit of familiarity.
Obsessive hobbies run in the family.

What might be particularly funny for long time Knipsbrat readers, is
that it wasn't immediately obvious that this would make a good birthday
present. My father is one of those ridiculous-to-shop-for people who
either has "it", or doesn't want "it."

One Christmas, my brother and I both showed up beaming with pride
asserting we had found the perfect gifts for our father. Imagine
everyone's surprise when my father opened two `Klein Bottles`_.

So, obviously my brother quickly agreed to partner with me on this
purchase of a fine Hilinski crokinole board: `Burton`_ is what we ended
up with. I'm looking forward to visiting and playing on it.

I've heard my father is looking into purchasing a few cues to deal with
his "`handicap`_." Maybe I can get him to guest write a post. The cues
category at the `WCC`_ does use lazy susan's, and requires players to
bring their own cue, but still adheres (pun intended) to the one-cheek
rule.
