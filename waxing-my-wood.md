Having found some inconsistencies with my first set of discs and
significant impact on the speed of the board. I ventured out of my house
to find some pure carnuba paste wax. Boardgamegreek and other crokinole
forum's highly recommend "Mothers pure carnuba wax."

Many car waxes, such as Turtle-brand, contain cleaners and chemicals
that are not good for the finished wood surfaces. I'm not sure, but this
"`Formula 1`_" brand wax appears to be only carnuba wax, and was
relatively inexpensive at my local Autozone.

I followed the directions on the can, and applied a little bit of wax to
the board and my discs. Its likely that I could have used more.

After letting it dry a bit, I wiped off the wax with a micro-fiber cloth
and found the process did indeed increase the speed of the discs
significantly. There was still a difference between side of a given
disc, but they all slid much farther after the waxing was done.
