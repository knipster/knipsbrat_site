The World Crokinole Championships are an all day event. Doubles
categories starts by 8:30am. Singles categories are held in the
afternoon and evening.

My son, Kieran, and I entered the recreational doubles category.
Simultaneously, the competitive category and the cues category held
their tournaments.

The first round of the WCC doubles are 6 games, each with against a
different opposing team. The teams that accumulate the largest number of
points at the end of the first round move on to the next round.

Each of the 6 games is made up of 4 rounds. Each of the 4 players gets a
chance to go first (and more importantly last). In doubles play, each
player gets 6 buttons (discs).

Kieran and I ended up placing 36 out of 46 teams. We're happy to have
accumulated 33 20s. We had a great time playing against some great
players.
