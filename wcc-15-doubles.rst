The World Crokinole Championships are an all day event.  Doubles categories starts by 8:30am. Singles categories are held in the afternoon and evening.

My son, Kieran, and I entered the recreational doubles category.  Simultaneously, the competitive category and the cues category held their tournaments.

The first round of the WCC doubles are 6 games, each with against a different opposing team.   The teams that accumulate the largest number of points at the end of the first round move on to the next round.

Each of the 6 games is made up of 4 rounds.  Each of the 4 players gets a chance to go first (and more importantly last).  In doubles play, each player gets 6 buttons (discs).

Kieran and I ended up placing 36 out of 46 teams and, more respectfully, accumulated 33 20's.   We had a great time playing against some great players.
