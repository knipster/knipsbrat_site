The World Crokinole Championships are an all day event.  Doubles categories starts by 8:30am. Singles categories are held in the afternoon and evening.

As Kieran headed over to compete in the juniors (6-10) category, I got in line to draw my number for the competitive singles category: **the main event**. 

I got one of the toughest (best) draws there could be:
1. (T3) Fred Slater
2. (#6) Louis Gauthier
3. (#1) Jon Conrad
4. Daryl MacDonald
5. Bren Mallette
6. (T3) Ray Bierling
7. (#5) Jason Bierling
8. (#21) Peter Tarle
9. Kirk Cornelius
10. Cole Fess 

*Parentheses indicate NCA Tour ranking for the 2012-2013 season. Daryl MacDonald has placed in past years WCC*

This is a test
