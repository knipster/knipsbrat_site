I first read about using gong bags as carrying cases for crokinole
boards over at
[BoardGameGeek](http://boardgamegeek.com/image/625727/crokinole).
There's a German seller mentioned, but clearly importing wasn't
something I was interested in.

[Gongs Unlimited](http://www.gongs-unlimited.com/lagobafor32t.html)
market cases specifically targeted at crokinole players both on their
own site as well as on eBay. They have received pretty good reviews.
After some correspondence, they appear to be out of stock for a couple
of months.

One of the issues with gong bags is the variability in size. A snug fit
is preferable to maximize the protection of the board. An 80cm bag
appear to be the target size for most tournament sized boards: 26 inch
surface+ 2\*[2 inch ditch + 1/4 inch rail]=30.5 inches=79 cm. it's
important to not be too small.

I ordered an *80cm Weiss Chau* gong bag from SteveWeiss music outside
Philadelphia, and it fits my Muzzies tournament board perfectly. My
puzzler board with wider rail can fit, but would be better suited by the
85cm bag.

The Weiss Chau bag is well padded around the perimeter as well as on the
front and bag surfaces. The zippers seem to be strong and durable and
are stitched nearly all the way around the bag. 2 handles on the surface
make picking up the loaded case safe and the shoulder handles keep the
board in control and away from the floor when carrying.

In summary, I highly recommend the Weiss Chau gong bag as a protective
carrying case for your crokinole board. At $35-$40 it's also the best
deal out there.
